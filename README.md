# synthesist

Simple sound synthesizer for experimentation.
Provides various oscillators, envelopes and a couple of effects.

Requires pyaudio and pygame.

Run "examples.py" for a basic flavour.

N.B. synth.py is a work-in-progress to build an interactive synthesizer using computer keyboard and midi keyboard input.
